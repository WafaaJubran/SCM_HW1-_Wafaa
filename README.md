This repository is made to accomplish the tasks assigned to me in the first homework of Software configuration management course.
The main idea of this homework is to let me understand github more and more until i become a proffesional in it.
The best practices of Software Configuration Management:
1-Good documentation:documents all project's files
2-Track changes:using github would make tracking of changes easy
3-compatibility:ensure that files are compatible with each other
