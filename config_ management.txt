Configuration management is important in software development because it encourages collaboration, which minimizes the amount of efforts and time spent if they work individually. It also enables the team to work on the same code but with different tasks so that they can perform different tasks at the same time. For example, member A performs corrective maintenance and member B may add a new functionality or something else. These configuration management features make teamwork easier!
